       "811  Thanks Jane,\\n\\nThank you for the update. Seems like we need to reevaluate our strategy. I am hesitant to change much at this moment given the likely update to senior leadership. Do you believe that current market trends will continue regarding small-cap consumer entertainment? \\n\\n Also, I am curious about our allocation in bond funds. Given current inflation, what is the likely impact on the bond market, i.e. should we consider moving further out of bonds? \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\n--\\nJessica Palmer\\nVP\\nHasbro\\nEmail: jessica.palmer@hasbro.com\\nPhone: 909.878.8329x31984\\n           Hasbro - Post Divestiture Strategy Adjustments  2025-07-08 09:40:00\n",
