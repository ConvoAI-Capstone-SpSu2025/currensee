They should be reasonably detailed, discussing specific (but fictional) corporate finance scenarios, market conditions relevant to businesses, Bankwell Financial services, proposed strategies, follow-ups, meeting logistics, etc. Avoid overly simplistic or generic messages.\n",
    "*   **Conversation Flow:** Emails between Jane and representatives of a specific client company must form logical conversation threads. A reply should clearly relate to the preceding email's subject and body in that thread. The `to_names`, `to_emails`, `from_name`, `from_email` fields must accurately reflect the sender and recipient(s) for each specific email in the thread.\n",
    "*   **Multiple Contacts:**\n",
    "    *   Vary correspondence. While most interactions will likely be 1-on-1 between Jane and the listed contact for a company (due to the provided data), sometimes simulate scenarios involving multiple recipients *from the same company*.\n",
    "    *   When an email involves multiple recipients (e.g., Jane emailing a client contact and hypothetically CC'ing a colleague, or a client contact replying to Jane and CC'ing a colleague):\n",
    "        *   List *all* recipient names in the `to_names` column, comma-separated.\n",
    "        *   List *all* corresponding recipient emails in the `to_emails` column, comma-separated, in the same order.\n",
    "        *   *Constraint:* Only include Jane and contacts from the *same client company* in a single email's `to_names`/`to_emails`. Do not mix contacts from different *client* companies.\n",

    "*   **Topics (B2B Focus):** Cover a variety of relevant corporate finance topics, tailoring discussion topics somewhat to the client company's *industry* (e.g., Healthcare, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Technology, Retail, Hospitality) as listed in the provided client data, while still covering a broad range of corporate finance issues:\n",
