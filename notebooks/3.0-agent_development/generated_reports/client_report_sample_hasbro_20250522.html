    </div>
    <div class="box-content">
        <h2>1. Past Email Summary</h2>
<p>Bankwell Financial and Hasbro have a long-standing relationship, primarily focused on FX hedging strategies for Hasbro's EUR and GBP exposures.  Initial discussions centered on comparing forward contracts and options for managing international sales receivables.  Hasbro adopted a primarily forward contract strategy with a small options overlay for H1 2021 and H1 2022, with successful execution reported.  Recent hedging strategy planning for H1 2023 and H1 2024 incorporated a more conservative risk profile and considered potential divestitures.  A recent Q1 performance review highlighted underperformance in small-cap consumer entertainment stocks, partially offset by structured notes linked to diversified consumer indexes.  This underperformance, coupled with concerns about inflation's impact on bonds and potential leadership changes at Hasbro, prompted a request to re-evaluate Hasbro's overall investment strategy.</p>
<h2>2. Recent Email Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Further diversification of Hasbro's investment portfolio is recommended.</li>
<li>Hasbro needs to re-evaluate its investment strategy, despite hesitation due to potential leadership changes.</li>
<li>The future of current market trends in small-cap consumer entertainment stocks is uncertain.</li>
<li>Hasbro is concerned about its bond fund allocation given current inflation.</li>
<li>Hasbro's small-cap consumer entertainment stock holdings underperformed the S&amp;P benchmark by 2.3% in the last six weeks.</li>
<li>Bankwell Financial suggests reallocating some discretionary sector holdings to lower-beta instruments or employing sector-rotation strategies.</li>
<li>Hasbro's structured notes tied to diversified consumer indexes helped mitigate some small-cap underperformance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Recent Client Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>"Do you believe that current market trends will continue regarding small-cap consumer entertainment?"</li>
<li>"Also, I am curious about our allocation in bond funds. Given current inflation, what is the likely impact on the bond market, i.e. should we consider moving further out of bonds?"</li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Financial Overview</h2>
<p>Hasbro's financial performance has been mixed. While Q1 2025 showed unexpectedly strong earnings driven by Wizards of the Coast, previous quarters (2023 and H1 2024) saw significant sales declines (up to 24% year-over-year in Q1 2024) and net losses ($428 million in the first nine months of 2023).  These were attributed to inflation, weaker toy demand, and fewer closeout sales.  Hasbro has implemented cost-cutting measures and a new growth strategy focused on digital gaming and older consumers.  The broader macroeconomic climate is uncertain, with concerns about a global recession driven by rising costs, weak demand, and the impact of tariffs.  While some companies like Walmart and Amazon show strength, others like Intel face challenges.  The overall sentiment is cautious, with many companies providing conservative outlooks.  Hasbro's holdings in small-cap consumer entertainment stocks underperformed recently, highlighting the need for diversification.  The impact of inflation on the bond market is a key concern for Hasbro.</p>
